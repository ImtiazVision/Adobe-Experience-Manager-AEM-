  - **Immutable Content Packages** : are immutable and are stored in the repository. They may be checked into Git and deployed through Cloud Manager. Immutable directories include /apps and /libs.

  - **Mutable Content Packages** : Typically, mutable material is committed to an AEM project using Maven archetypes. Service users, directories, node kinds, customizable templates, and scripts, among other things, are all included in the content.

  - **Content Package Structure** : Deployments must include a single Experience Manager package that includes code, configuration, and baseline content. Because the experience manager demands a separation of content and code, a single content package cannot be deployed to both applications and runtime editable regions of the repository such as content, conf, home, and so on. It is made up of the following components: 1. ui.apps, which contains all of the code and is delivered to applications, 2. The ui.content/ code package comprises all of the content and configuration and is located in /conf, /etc, /var, /home, and /content.
