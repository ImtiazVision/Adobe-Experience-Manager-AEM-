### Single Page Application (SPA)

SPA is an abbreviation for Single Page Application. It is essentially a JavaScript application that uses AJAX requests to load data and dynamically update the page. The majority of the material is obtained once in a single page load, with additional resources loaded asynchronously when needed based on user interaction with the page, reducing the need for page refresh and providing a smooth, quick, and native app experience. The majority of SPA frameworks load content through dynamic JSON using Angular and React.
