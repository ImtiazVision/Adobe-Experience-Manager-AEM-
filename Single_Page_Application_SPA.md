### Single Page Application (SPA)

SPA is an abbreviation for Single Page Application. It is essentially a JavaScript application that uses AJAX requests to load data and dynamically update the page. The majority of the material is obtained once in a single page load, with additional resources loaded asynchronously when needed based on user interaction with the page, reducing the need for page refresh and providing a smooth, quick, and native app experience. The majority of SPA frameworks load content through dynamic JSON using Angular and React.

### AEM SPA Editor 

The AEM SPA editor provides a complete solution for supporting SPAs inside AEM. As a result, the SPA editor enables front end developers to design SPAs that can be incorporated into the AEM site, while simultaneously enabling content authors to change the SPA material as easily as any other AEM content. Mapping between the JSON output of the SPA and the content model in the AEM repository is required to allow modification of SPAs inside AEM.
